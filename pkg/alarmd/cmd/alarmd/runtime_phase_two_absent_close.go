// may send the same closes again; the link treats a close for an alert that
// is no longer active as a no-op, so a repeat costs a message, not a state.
//
// absentCloseInterval is how often the leader takes the difference. The
// bound is the grace: a candidate has to be seen missing by two rounds under
