// still selected by the static list and host 2 by g2: both stay expected,
// their absences open since round 1, raised again on round 2. Host 3 was in g1
// alone: it leaves the expected set, and its absence is closed and forgotten.
//
// A new process runs round 2, so the empty g1 is what its group store reads
// first. The close is read where it is decided, in the memory: host 3 is
// gone from it and was not raised again, hosts 1 and 2 keep their round 1
// absences. What becomes of the close on its way out of a process that did
// not raise the alert is the open alert gate's matter and is not read here.
