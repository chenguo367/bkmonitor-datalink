// through the production bundle on the native protocol: the strategy compiled
// from its document, the open-alert gate wired as in production, real Redis.
//
// The expectations are written out per round from the definitions, not read
// from a run. The alert is raised by the continuous-th consecutive absent
// point, the points one period apart; a round whose query was not FULL
// contributes no point and bridges nothing (P9). One round with data closes
// an open alert (P11, one recovery window), and only an open one: a RECOVERY
// reaches the consumer only for an alert it holds (the open-alert gate). A
// new absence after a close starts from nothing. A round not FULL is neither
// an absent point nor a present one: it neither raises nor closes, so an
// open alert stays open across it until data actually returns.
