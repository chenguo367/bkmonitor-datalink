// segments that were pruned.

// these up or compares them: an unknown number of object-windows that were
// never detected, reported as the smallest non-zero amount of them.
//

// Slot that was skipped -- it is the first one the timeline still holds and the
// Progress will evaluate it -- so putting it in LastSlot would both break the
// bound every other gap keeps (the last skipped Slot precedes the next one) and
// name a skipped Slot that was not skipped. Recorded separately, the extent is
// stated without the population being invented: the first skipped Slot is
// known, where the cursor landed is known, and how many lie between them is
