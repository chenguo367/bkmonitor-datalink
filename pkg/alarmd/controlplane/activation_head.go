// write, and every replica read after it, cost the whole population rather
// than what changed (N15, review C1/C2).
//
// A later build stops writing that copy: its body is a head (schema v3, no
// Plans). This build writes the head. It also reads a body with its Plans,
// which the build before it wrote and a rollback to it writes again:
//
//   - every reader that wants the head reads it through LoadActivationHead
//     and never touches the records;
//   - the Control Leader, which does need the records, gets them back from
//     the open Segments when the body has none (LoadActivation).
