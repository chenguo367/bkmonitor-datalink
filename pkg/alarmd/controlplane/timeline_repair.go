// A Query Group whose Schedule timeline stopped decoding used to stay that
// way. Three scripts write a timeline: the first activation, which writes
// only where no key exists; the cutover, which writes only the Query Groups a
// publication changes and fences each on the bytes it read; and the renewal,
// which only extends the key's life - the bad bytes with it. The cutover
// reads an unchanged Query Group's timeline once per process and then trusts
// the manifest, and when it did read bytes that would not decode it held the
// Query Group back, unwritten. A reconcile with no new publication read
// nothing at all. The Worker meeting the bytes named the round
// SCHEDULE_UNREADABLE and told nobody, so the Query Group ran nothing for as
// long as the key lived, which the renewal made forever.
//
// Now the Worker names such Query Groups on its registration, the Leader
// reads them each round, and the activation reconciler reads each named one
// again itself and rewrites the ones that still do not decode: one Segment
// from the Leader's boundary carrying the content the Query Group runs and
// its activation records unchanged, fenced on the bytes that did not decode,
// with the Segment marked (execution.SegmentRepair) so the Worker records the
// Slots lost with the old timeline instead of jumping past them silently. A
// cutover that meets such bytes rewrites them the same way rather than
// holding the Query Group back. The Leader decodes for itself and rewrites
// only what it cannot read either: a Worker of an older build that cannot
// read a newer timeline names it, and the Leader finds it decodes.

// TimelineRepairOutcome is what became of one Query Group named as having an
// unreadable timeline.
