// HostTopologyFuller is the CMDB half of enrichment: it turns the host
// identities a series carries into the topology nodes that host belongs to,
// plus the host attributes later filters act on.
//
// It is the counterpart of Python's access fuller, and the reason enrichment
// is a stage rather than part of the filter: the next thing to add - more host
// attributes, service-instance topology, container facts - lands here without
// touching the filters or the call site.
//
// Everything it learns goes into the facts and nothing into the dimensions.
// Python writes bk_topo_node, bk_target_ip and bk_host_id back into the
// record; this side takes the decisions those writes lead to and not the
// writes, because a dimension that follows CMDB changes the alert's identity
// every time CMDB does.
