// The writer's contract, from the CMDB cache publisher (publish_hashes and
// its sources): every round renames a staging hash over the key and deletes
// its placeholder, and leaves a mapping whose query failed out of the round,
// so the one before stands until its TTL. It cannot state an empty mapping -
// a hash with no fields does not exist - so a missing key is no clusters, a
// mapping left out of its rounds past its TTL, or no publisher at all. The
// reader rule: a hash that is there is read as written; a missing key maps
// nothing and is named missing, the writer's TTL having already carried its
// last good mapping; a key that cannot be read is the reader's own error, so
// the last mapping read stands, named read_failed, until a read succeeds.
