// observers down either. A fan-out (Multi) therefore gives each of its
// observers the observation on its own, and a panic in one is recovered
// there and counted under that observer's name; the observers after it
// still receive the observation. Recovered and not counted, as it was, a
// panic was invisible, and every observer after the panicking one silently
// missed every observation it panicked on.

// counts as ObserverUnnamed.
