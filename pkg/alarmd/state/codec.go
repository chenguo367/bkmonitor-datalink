// RuntimeEnvelopeUpperBoundV2 is the shape-only upper bound for the persisted
// Runtime State record, the JSON envelope execution v2 actually writes.
//
// It exists beside PackedEncodedUpperBoundV1 because the two representations
// are not within a constant factor of each other and only one of them is what
// the store holds. The packed blob spends 19 bytes on a point; the JSON record
// spends about 234 for one Level and 353 for two, because it repeats per point
// what the packed form hoists: a 64-character record id whose first 16 bytes
// are all anyone reads, and a 64-character detect fingerprint that is compared
// for equality against the Level's own and then discarded - a value that is
// identical for every point of a Level by construction, since a point whose
// fingerprint differs is an invariant violation.
//
// That difference has a consequence nobody wrote down. MaxValueBytes is the
// codec's byte budget, sized for the packed form, and it is applied unchanged
// to the record that costs 12 to 18 times more per point. So the point ceiling
// the configuration states - 4096, in both the compiler and the codec - cannot
// be reached in the representation in use: the real one is about 2200 points
// for one Level and about 1480 for two. A strategy configured between those
// compiles cleanly and then has every state write refused as budget exceeded,
// per series, silently, for as long as it exists.
//
// Deriving the compile-time ceiling from this function is what keeps the two
// in step. When the record becomes the packed form the arithmetic changes here
// and the stated 4096 becomes reachable again, with nothing else to revisit.
