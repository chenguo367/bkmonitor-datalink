// The distinction matters because UQ answers an expression, not a table. An
// expression with a fallback - `(1 - (a + b) / c) * 100 or vector(100)`, which
// is how a success-rate strategy says "no failures means 100%" - resolves to a
// series even when none of its sub-queries route anywhere, and UQ reports both:
// the constant series, and the code saying the tables were not found. Both are
// true. Treating the code as the whole answer threw away a series the strategy
// was defined to produce, and two strategies went ~34 hours without a single
// evaluation while Python evaluated them normally every cycle.
//
// The list is deliberately one entry. Everything not on it stays UNAVAILABLE,
// which is the direction that fails visibly, and a new code has to be reviewed
// in rather than default in:
//
//   - SPACE_IS_NOT_EXISTS is also an existence statement, but for a whole
//     space, and it is raised when the space router has no entry - which a
//     router that failed to load also produces. Wrong here silences every
//     strategy in the space.
//   - EXCEEDS_MAXIMUM_LIMIT / EXCEEDS_MAXIMUM_SLIMIT mean data exists and was
//     cut short. That is the opposite of empty.
//   - STORAGE_TIMEOUT / STORAGE_ERROR / QUERY_RAW_ERROR are the query failing.
//   - SPACE_TABLE_ID_FIELD_MISSING_FALLBACK is annotated in UQ as metadata
//     possibly being stale, so it is transient by construction. It is also
//     only ever logged, never set as a status, so it cannot reach here at all -
//     but it is the one that would look most like a member of this list.
//   - TABLE_ID_PROXY_IS_NOT_EXISTS is declared in UQ and never assigned.
//
// What puts the one entry on the list is not the source reading: it is a replay
// of the two strategies' own compiled queries against the deployed UQ, which
// answered with exactly this code beside a usable fallback series. The source
// reading (pkg/unify-query/metadata/const.go and the assignment sites in
// query/structured/space.go, at bkmonitor-datalink master rather than the
// deployed tag) supports only the exclusions above, where being wrong means
// keeping today's behaviour.

// usableDespiteStatus reports whether a response carrying code should still be

//
// Both halves are required. Without a delivered series there is nothing to
// keep and the answer really is "this does not exist", which UNAVAILABLE
// already states correctly - so a query that returned nothing behaves exactly
// as before. Without the code check, "some sub-queries failed but one
// succeeded" would be read the same way as "the expression answered by
// itself", and those need opposite handling.
//
// What keeps those two apart is an ordering in UQ, not the codes being
// mutually exclusive: SetStatus holds one slot and the last writer wins
// (metadata/status.go), the routing statuses are written while the query is
// being built, and the multi-route partial status is written after the fan-out
// finishes (tsdb/prometheus/querier.go - it even keeps the earlier message and
// replaces only the code). So a response that really did lose a route reports
// QUERY_TS_PARTIAL as its final code and never reaches this list, while an
// existence code surviving as the final code means no route reported a partial
// failure and the series came from the expression itself.
//
// is_partial is a second, independent guard: it comes back from the storage
// instance rather than from the status slot, and a true value still completes
// the query as PARTIAL further down whatever the code says.
